v.0.1

This game is Portal 'demade' as a top-down puzzle game.

Portal is a copyright of Valve Corp., and as such, I am not claiming this
material as originally my own. This game is really just practice in game
development and programming.

INSTRUCTIONS:

To download the game, you can download the whole project and/or the
folder named "Download". In the download folder you can run the
executable file there, or run the entire project through the solution.
Not having tested it, you may have to download the Microsoft XNA
framework in order to run the game, and you will definitely have to 
download the Microsoft .NET framework, although a Windows 7 computer
will do that automatically if you have automatic updates on. If you do
not, just update your computer manually, choosing just to update the
.NET framework or all of the suggested updates.

To play the game:
Control the character using WASD.

A mouse is also necessary to play this game.
The mouse position aims the portal gun.
Left click and right click to shoot portals.

When entering a portal, press the spacebar to move through.

As in the original Portal, the light gray blocks can support portals,
and the dark gray blocks do not. The black blocks are "pits 'o death",
but have not been implemented yet.

NOTE:
The background was an arbitrarily chosen screenshot of the
Team Fortress 2 loading screen, and again, was not created by me, 
but by Valve Corp. However, please do note the high score held by
my engineer, and be in awe.
