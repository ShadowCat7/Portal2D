v.0.1

This game is Portal 'demade' as a top-down puzzle game.

Portal is a copyright of Valve Corp., and as such, I am not claiming this
material as originally my own. This game is really just practice in game
development and programming.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS:
Control the character using WASD.

A mouse is also necessary to play this game.
The mouse position aims the portal gun.
Left click and right click to shoot portals.

When entering a portal, press the spacebar to move through.

As in the original Portal, the light gray blocks can support portals,
and the dark gray blocks do not. The black blocks are "pits 'o death",
but have not been implemented yet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE:
The background was an arbitrarily chosen screenshot of the
Team Fortress 2 loading screen, and again, was not created by me, 
but by Valve Corp. However, please do note the high score held by
my engineer, and be in awe.
